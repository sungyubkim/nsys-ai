analyzer.py — Analyze NVTX trees to find multi-kernel regions for refinement.

After profiling with NVTX annotations, this module examines the resulting
tree structure to determine which NVTX regions need finer-grained scoping.

The convergence criterion: each innermost NVTX should contain exactly one
GPU kernel. Regions with multiple kernels are candidates for refinement.
