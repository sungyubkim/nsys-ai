timeline/ — Textual-based horizontal timeline TUI package.

Replaces the monolithic curses-based tui_timeline.py.

Public API:
    run_timeline(db_path, device, trim, min_ms=0)

Note: Textual is imported lazily inside run_timeline to avoid stalling at
package import time when Textual is not installed.
