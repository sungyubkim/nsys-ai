persona.py — The agent's soul: identity, principles, and system prompt.

The nsys-ai agent is a CUDA machine learning systems performance expert.
This module defines its identity, knowledge structure, and the system prompt
that can be sent to an LLM backend for agentic analysis.

The system prompt lives in persona.md (same directory) so it can be edited
as plain Markdown. This module loads it at import time and exposes the same
public API: AGENT_IDENTITY, SYSTEM_PROMPT, build_system_prompt().
